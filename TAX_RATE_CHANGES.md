# Tax Rate Changes Summary

## Overview
Updated the application from 18% GST to 12% GST for steel tube products as per Indian tax regulations for steel products.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tax Rate Configuration (`src/config/taxRates.js`)
- Created centralized tax rate configuration system
- Default 12% GST for all steel tube categories
- Product-type aware tax calculation
- Helper functions for validation and formatting
- HSN code mapping for steel tubes (7306, 7307, 7308)

### 2. Component Updates

#### QuotationForm.jsx
- **Before**: Default tax: 18%, Placeholder: "18"
- **After**: Default tax: 12%, Placeholder: "12"
- Updated calculation to use `calculateTaxAmount()` helper
- Enhanced validation to enforce valid GST rates

#### DO1Generator.jsx
- **Before**: `const taxAmount = subtotal * 0.18; // 18% GST`
- **After**: Uses `calculateTaxAmount(subtotal, STEEL_TUBE_TAX_RATE, item.type)`
- Updated UI to show "Tax (12%)" instead of "Tax (18%)"

#### InvoiceViewer.jsx
- **Before**: `const gstRate = 18;`
- **After**: `const gstRate = STEEL_TUBE_TAX_RATE;`

#### TallyPush.jsx
- **Before**: "Calculates GST (18% - 9% CGST + 9% SGST)"
- **After**: "Calculates GST (12% - 6% CGST + 6% SGST for steel tubes)"

### 3. Form Validation
- Updated to accept only valid GST rates: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%
- Provides clear error messages for invalid rates

## Testing Results

### Tax Calculation Verification
```javascript
Input: ₹10,000 subtotal
Tax Rate: 12%
Tax Amount: ₹1,200
Total: ₹11,200
```

### Product Type Support
- Square Tubes: 12% GST
- Rectangular Tubes: 12% GST  
- Round Tubes: 12% GST
- Oval Tubes: 12% GST
- Custom Steel Products: 12% GST

## Benefits

1. **Compliance**: Now follows correct GST rates for steel products in India
2. **Consistency**: All components use the same tax calculation logic
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to update tax rates through configuration
4. **Validation**: Prevents invalid tax rates from being entered
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration makes updates simple

## Migration Notes

- Existing quotations with 18% tax will continue to work
- New quotations will default to 12% tax
- Tax rate can still be manually adjusted if needed
- All calculations are backwards compatible

## Configuration

To change tax rates in the future, update `src/config/taxRates.js`:

```javascript
export const STEEL_TUBE_TAX_RATE = 12; // Change this value
export const TAX_RATES_BY_CATEGORY = {
  'square-tubes': 12,  // Update individual categories
  // ... other categories
};
```
