# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

### Start Development Environment
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev

# Start frontend only (port 3000)
npm start

# Start backend only (port 5000)
npm run server
```

### Testing and Building
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Build production frontend
npm run build
```

## Testing Guidelines with Playwright MCP

### IMPORTANT: Always Test Changes with Playwright MCP
When working on this application, you MUST use the Playwright MCP tools to test your changes thoroughly. This is critical for ensuring code quality and catching issues early.

#### Testing Workflow
1. **Before Making Changes**: Take baseline screenshots and document current behavior
2. **After Making Changes**: Test the affected functionality extensively
3. **Iterative Testing**: Use test findings to refine and correct your changes
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Test related workflows that might be impacted

#### Required Testing Steps
```bash
# The development server is already running on port 3000
# Simply use Playwright MCP tools to:
# - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 for testing
# - Take screenshots for visual verification
# - Test form submissions and user interactions
# - Verify API responses and error handling
# - Check console for errors or warnings
```

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Test Critical User Flows**: Lead Creation ‚Üí Quotation ‚Üí PO ‚Üí DO1 ‚Üí DO2 ‚Üí Invoice
- **Verify Data Integrity**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Check Error States**: Test invalid inputs and network failures
- **Validate UI/UX**: Ensure responsive design and accessibility
- **Monitor Console**: Watch for JavaScript errors, API failures, and warnings

#### When to Test
- **Always**: After fixing bugs or adding features
- **Required**: Before marking any TODO item as complete
- **Critical**: When modifying:
  - API endpoints or database schemas
  - Form validation or submission logic
  - Navigation or routing components
  - Data fetching or state management

#### Test Documentation
- Take screenshots of before/after states
- Document any issues found during testing
- Update APP_ISSUES.md if new problems are discovered
- Include test results in commit messages when applicable

#### Failure Response
If Playwright testing reveals issues:
1. **Stop immediately** - Do not proceed with other changes
2. **Analyze the root cause** of the failure
3. **Fix the underlying issue** - don't just patch symptoms
4. **Re-test thoroughly** to ensure the fix works
5. **Test related functionality** that might be affected

## Task Management and Git Workflow

### TODO.md Task Completion
When you complete a task during development:

1. **Check TODO.md**: Search for the completed task in the TODO.md file
2. **Mark as Complete**: If the task exists in TODO.md, change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` to mark it complete
3. **Update Task Status**: This provides clear progress tracking for the project

#### Example Task Completion
```markdown
# Before completion
- [ ] **Fix inventory items flickering bug on Inventory Dashboard page**

# After completion
- [x] **Fix inventory items flickering bug on Inventory Dashboard page**
```

### Git Commit Guidelines
After successfully testing changes with Playwright MCP:

#### When to Commit
- **REQUIRED**: After Playwright testing confirms changes work correctly
- **REQUIRED**: Before marking any TODO item as complete
- **ALWAYS**: Include test results in commit verification

#### Terminal Workflow for Testing and Committing
```bash
# Development server is already running on http://localhost:3000
# Use terminal for git commands and other operations:
git status
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "..."
```

#### Commit Message Format
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

#### Git Commands - IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS
**‚úÖ ALLOWED Git Operations:**
- `git status` - Check working tree status
- `git diff` - View changes made
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit` - Create commits with detailed messages
- `git log` - View commit history

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN Git Operations:**
- `git push` - NEVER push to remote repository
- `git checkout` - NEVER change branches
- `git merge` - NEVER merge branches
- `git rebase` - NEVER rebase commits
- Any commands that modify remote state or branch structure

#### Example Complete Workflow

# 2. Test with Playwright MCP (navigate to http://localhost:3000)
# 3. Check TODO.md and mark task complete if applicable
# 4. Commit changes:

git status
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fix: Update product categories to steel tube industry specific

- Replace generic categories (Electronics, Clothing) with steel tube products
- Add Square Tubes, Rectangular Tubes, Round Tubes, Oval Tubes, Custom Steel Products
- Update LeadCreation.jsx product dropdown options
- Ensure form validation accepts new categories

‚úÖ Tested with Playwright MCP:
- Verified new categories appear in Lead Creation form
- Tested form submission with new product types
- Screenshots confirmed UI displays correctly

Fixes: TODO.md - Update product categories task

### Development Server Management
**IMPORTANT**: The development server is already running and managed for you:

1. **Application URL**: Always available at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **No server management needed**: Server is automatically maintained
3. **Direct testing access**: Use Playwright MCP to navigate to localhost:3000
4. **Consistent environment**: Server stays running for reliable testing

This ensures a stable testing environment without server management overhead during development.

### Individual Testing
```bash
# Test specific API endpoints using curl or Postman
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test SMS functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/sms/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "9876543210", "message": "Test message"}'
```

## Architecture Overview

### Full-Stack MERN Application
- **Frontend**: React 19 with React Router for SPA navigation
- **Backend**: Express.js API server with RESTful endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Yup validation

### Key Application Domains

#### 1. Lead Management Flow
- **Lead Creation** ‚Üí **Quotations** ‚Üí **Purchase Orders** ‚Üí **DO1 (Delivery Order 1)** ‚Üí **DO2 (Delivery Order 2)** ‚Üí **Invoicing**
- Each stage has dedicated components and API endpoints
- Full audit trail tracking for all operations

#### 2. Inventory Management

- **SMS**: MSG91 integration for dispatch notifications
- Automatic notifications triggered during DO2 execution

### Core Components Architecture

#### Frontend (src/components/)
- **Dashboard Navigation**: Single-page tabbed interface in App.js
- **Form Components**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **Viewers**: Dedicated components for viewing invoices, audit trails
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for reports and analytics

- **Routes**: RESTful API endpoints organized by domain
- **Services**: Email and SMS service abstractions
- **Server**: Express application with CORS, MongoDB connection, and graceful shutdown

### Database Schema Relationships
- Lead ‚Üí Quotation ‚Üí PurchaseOrder ‚Üí DO1 ‚Üí DO2 ‚Üí Invoice
- Inventory items linked to POs and DOs for stock tracking
- Audit trails maintained for Invoice and other critical operations

### Environment Configuration
- `.env` file required for MongoDB URI, MSG91 SMS credentials, email settings
